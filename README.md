# KAPy - *Klimaatlases* in Python

KAPy is an open-source and flexible framework that can be used to generate climate indicators anywhere in the world, working from datasets such as CMIP and CORDEX together with observations. KAPy is a ground-up python-based rethink of the pipeline originally developed to power the Danish Meteorological Institute's *Klimaatlas* climate service, but is intended to be used more widely.

## Getting started

Here we describe the basic steps to install and configure KAPy. First, you need to get a copy of the KAPy source code onto the machine where you want to work. This is most easily done using git to clone the latest version of the code directly from the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Klimaatlas/KAPy.git
```
This approach also has the advantage of making it easy to get updates directly into your local folder. If you don't have git installed, you can download a zipped version of the source code directly from the website, here: https://github.com/Klimaatlas/KAPy/releases 

Next, we need to setup the Python environment containing the packages used by KAPy. Add-on libraries in Python are referred to as "packages" and their installation is maintained by a package manager, of which there are many to choose from (e.g. Anaconda, Conda, Miniconda, Mamba, Micromamba etc), although some, particularly Anaconda, require paid-for licenses in some use-cases. KAPy is developed around packages from the conda-forge and bioconda channels and the example code given here is for the miniforge version of conda - you can download it from https://conda-forge.org/download/ if you don't have it already. KAPy should however work just as well with other package managers. The examples are also for a Linux environment - however, a similar approach will hold if you want to try and get KAPy running in Windows.

A list of packages required to run KAPy can be found in the file [`./workflow/envs/env.yaml`](./workflow/envs/env.yaml). In the case of Conda, this list can be used to create an environment as follows:

```
conda env create --file ./workflow/envs/env.yaml
```

The resulting environment (called `KAPy`) is a self-contained setup that has everything necessary to run KAPy. The KAPy environment needs to be activated prior to use:

```
conda activate KAPy
```

And so you're ready to go. To get familiar with the workings of KAPy, we recommend looking at the document listed below, and particularly the [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/README.md).

In the future, you may need to update the environment to reflect changes. This can be done with:

```
conda env update --file ./workflow/envs/env.yaml --prune

```

or by deleting the environment and installing it again from scratch:

```
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n KAPy
conda env create --file ./workflow/envs/env.yaml
```

## Why KAPy?

KAPy takes its name from joining the `KA` from DMI's *Klimaatlas* with the `Py` from Python, in the style of many Python libraries. 

More importantly, the name is also a homonym for the phrase *ka pai* from *Te Reo Māori*, the language of the Māori people, the *tangata whenua* (indigenous people) of Aotearoa New Zealand. The phrase means simply "good", but can also be used as praise, as in "well done". e.g.
```
Son: Look Dad! I made a Klimaatlas in Python!
Dad: Ka pai, son, ka pai!
```

# This YAML file defines the optional requirements used in the development of KAPy.
#
# To setup the KAPy-dev environment, first create the base KAPy environemnt - see 
# instructions in requirements.yaml. Once this is complete, clone the KAPy environment:
#
# conda create --name KAPy-dev --clone KAPy
#
# Next, install the additional elements required by KAPy-dev
#
# conda env update -f dev_requirements.yaml
#
# The resulting environment with all dependencies and version numbers can then 
# exported back to dev.yaml like so:
#
# conda env export > dev.yaml
#
# An alternative strategy can be to build the full environment first, combining
# both sets of requirements, clone the full environment, and then uninstall the
# development packages. This has worked well in situations where solutions
# cannot be found  for adding the packages below.
